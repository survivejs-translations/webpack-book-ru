# Build Analysis

Analyzing build statistics is a good step towards understanding webpack better. Visualizing webpack output helps you to understand the composition of your bundles.

## Configuring Webpack

To get suitable output, you need to do a couple of tweaks to the configuration. At a minimum, you should set the `--json` flag and pipe the output to a file as follows:

**package.json**

```json
"scripts": {
leanpub-start-insert
  "build:stats": "webpack --env production --json > stats.json",
leanpub-end-insert
  ...
},
```

The above is the basic setup you need, regardless of your webpack configuration. Execute `npm run build:stats` now. After a while you should find *stats.json* at your project root. This file can be pushed through a variety of tools to understand better what's going on.

You can also consider using the following flags:

* `--profile` to capture timing-related information. The setting is optional but good to set.
* `--progress` to show how long webpack spent in different stages of the build.

T> To understand why webpack includes a specific module to the build while processing, use [whybundled](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whybundled) or [webpack-why](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-why). `--display-reasons` flag gives more information as well. Example: `npm run build -- --display-reasons`.

W> Given you piggyback on the production target in the current setup; this process cleans the build directory! If you want to avoid that, set up a separate destination where you don't clean.

### Node API

Stats can be captured through Node. Since stats can contain errors, so it's a good idea to handle that case separately:

```javascript
const webpack = require("webpack");
const config = require("./webpack.config.js")("production");

webpack(config, (err, stats) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err);
  }

  if (stats.hasErrors()) {
    return console.error(stats.toString("errors-only"));
  }

  console.log(stats);
});
```

This technique can be valuable if you want to do further processing on stats although often the other solutions are enough.

T> If you want JSON output from `stats`, use `stats.toJson()`. To get *verbose* output, use `stats.toJson("verbose")`. It follows all stat options webpack supports.

T> To mimic the `--json` flag, use `console.log(JSON.stringify(stats.toJson(), null, 2));`. The output is formatted to be readable.

### `StatsWebpackPlugin` and `WebpackStatsPlugin`

If you want to manage stats through a plugin, check out [stats-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stats-webpack-plugin). It gives you a bit more control over the output. You can use it to exclude specific dependencies from the output.

[webpack-stats-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-stats-plugin) is another option. It allows you to transform the data before outputting it.

## Enabling a Performance Budget

Webpack allows you to define a **performance budget**. The idea is that it gives your build size constraint which it has to follow. The feature is disabled by default and the calculation includes extracted chunks to entry calculation. If a budget isn't met and it has been configured to emit an error, it would terminate the entire build.

{pagebreak}

To integrate the feature into the project, adjust the configuration:

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
const productionConfig = merge([
leanpub-start-insert
  {
    performance: {
      hints: "warning", // "error" or false are valid too
      maxEntrypointSize: 50000, // in bytes, default 250k
      maxAssetSize: 450000, // in bytes
    },
  },
leanpub-end-insert
  ...
]);
```

In practice, you want to maintain lower limits. The current ones are enough for this demonstration. If you build now (`npm run build`), you should see a warning:

```bash
WARNING in entrypoint size limit: The following entrypoint(s) combined asset size exceeds the recommended limit (48.8 KiB). This can impact web performance.
Entrypoints:
  main (103 KiB)
      manifest.3fd9a1eb.js
      manifest.d41d8cd9.css
      vendor.0a4df2ff.js
      vendor.3dd53418.css
      main.9043ef51.js
      main.d5d711b1.css
```

You can increase the limit or remove the configuration to get rid of the warning. An attractive option would be to replace React with a lighter alternative as discussed in the *Обработка пакетов* chapter.

In addition to inspectpack, there are other tools for figuring out duplicates:

* [bundle-duplicates-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-duplicates-plugin) operates on a function level.
* [find-duplicate-dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-duplicate-dependencies) achieves the same on an npm package level.
* [depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck) goes further and warns if there are redundant dependencies or dependencies missing from the project.
* [bundle-buddy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-buddy) can find duplicates across bundles while providing a user interface to tune webpack code splitting behavior. [bundle-buddy-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bundle-buddy-webpack-plugin) makes it simpler to use.

## Independent Tools

In addition to tools that work with webpack output, there are a couple that are webpack agnostic and worth a mention.

### source-map-explorer

[source-map-explorer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-explorer) is a tool independent of webpack. It allows you to get insight into your build by using source maps. It gives a treemap based visualization showing what code contributes to the result.

### madge

![madge](images/madge.png)

[madge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madge) is another independent tool that can output a graph based on module input. The graph output allows you to understand the dependencies of your project in greater detail.

{pagebreak}

## Conclusion

When you are optimizing the size of your bundle output, these tools are invaluable. The official tool has the most functionality, but even a rudimentary visualization can reveal problem spots. You can use the same technique with old projects to understand their composition.

To recap:

* Webpack allows you to extract a JSON file containing information about the build. The data can include the build composition and timing.
* The generated data can be analyzed using various tools that give insight into aspects such as the bundle composition.
* **Performance budget** allows you to set limits to the build size. Maintaining a budget can keep developers more conscious of the size of the generated bundles.
* Understanding the bundles is the key to insights on how to optimize the overall size, what to load and when. It can also reveal more significant issues, such as redundant data.
* You can find third-party tools that don't depend on webpack but are still valuable for analysis.

You'll learn to tune webpack performance in the next chapter.
